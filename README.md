## Development Tips

1. **Component Customization**
   - Each component is built with Tailwind CSS for easy styling
   - Modify the JSX and Tailwind classes to match your design needs
   - Components are TypeScript-based for better type safety

2. **Adding New Pages**
   - Create a new directory in `src/app/`
   - Add a `page.tsx` file in the new directory
   - Use the `PageHeader` component for consistent styling

3. **Styling**
   - Global styles are in `src/app/globals.css`
   - Utility functions are available in `src/lib/utils.ts`
   - Tailwind CSS classes can be customized in `tailwind.config.ts`

## Accessibility

This boilerplate is built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Key accessibility features include:

1. **Proper Alt Text Implementation**
   - All content images have descriptive alt text
   - Decorative images use empty alt attributes
   - Background images have appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Icons include screen reader text

2. **Accessibility Guidelines**
   - Detailed accessibility guidelines are available in `docs/accessibility-guidelines.md`
   - Follow these guidelines when adding new content to maintain accessibility compliance

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Focus states are clearly visible

4. **Semantic HTML**
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Semantic elements used throughout

Refer to the accessibility guidelines document for detailed information on maintaining accessibility when extending this boilerplate.

## Internationalization

This boilerplate includes support for hreflang tags, which help search engines understand which language you are using on a specific page.

### Current Implementation

- The site is configured with English (`en`) as the default language
- Hreflang tags are implemented in the metadata of each page
- Utility functions in `src/lib/hreflang.ts` make it easy to generate hreflang metadata

### Adding More Languages

To add support for additional languages:

1. Update the language configuration in `src/lib/schema-config.ts`
2. Create translated versions of your pages
3. Update the URL structure as needed

For detailed information on the hreflang implementation and how to extend it, see the [Hreflang Implementation Guide](docs/hreflang-implementation.md).
